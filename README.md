# Mini Challenge 5-7 Endpoints <br><br>

<b>Name:</b> David Jimenez<br>
<b>Project:</b> Mini Challenge - 5-7 Endpoint MVC <br>
<b>Date:</b> 04/05/2024 <br>
<strong>Description:</strong> <br>
Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine: <br>
<br>
* You may have multiple controllers inside a Controller folder, or you can have multiple endpoints in a single controller in a Controller folder. <br>
* Validation is required. If a mathematical endpoint is provided a string or other invalid data, your endpoint should have a response prepared for it. <br>
<br>
Endpoints: <br>
1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.<br><br>

2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.<br><br>

3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.  For example:<br>
     - "You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321"<br><br>

4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed.  For example:<br>
     - "You entered 12345, reversed is 54321"<br><br>

Things to turn in:<br>
- Project, zipped<br>
- Github link in comments<br>
- Don't forget the peer review!<br><br>

Comments: Code runs perfectly, and is formatted nicely. Like the use of validation for integers only on the reverse numbers function, and I Don't see any flaws in the code.  <br>
